# üß∞ GitHub Integration

Project Platter can create a GitHub repository via API during project setup.

## üîë Requirements

- GitHub username
- Personal Access Token (PAT)

### Recommended PAT Type
Use a **Classic Personal Access Token** with:

- `public_repo` (for public repos)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Fine-grained tokens often fail for repo creation.

3. On success, clones URL and configures remote  
4. Pushes commits and branches if requested
